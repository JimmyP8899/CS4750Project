# Budget Buddy

This android app solves the problem of budgeting finances using the 50-30-20 rule, where 50% of income goes to your needs, 30% goes into your wants, and 20% goes into your savings. In the app you input your salary and your expected percent growth for your investments. The app will return a breakdown of each of these categories. The user can specify whether they want monthly breakdowns of costs or yearly breakdowns. The app also has a selections page to verify your selections, as well as a projected growth page which calculates your projected growth over 5 years, 10 years or 20 years based on the inputted expected percent growth. 

## Getting Started

To get started, clone the repository and run the app with android studio.
